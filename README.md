#Weather Web App

This project is a responsive weather web application built using Svelte and TypeScript. It allows users to check real-time weather information and forecasts for any city or their current location. The app fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API and provides an intuitive interface with features such as:





City Search: Users can search for weather information by entering a city name.



Geolocation: Automatically fetch weather data based on the user's current location.



Hourly and Daily Forecasts: Displays hourly weather for the next 12 hours and daily forecasts for the upcoming week.



Dynamic Theme: Switches between light and dark modes based on the time of day (day/night) using sunrise and sunset data.



Interactive Modal: Shows a custom message based on the temperature when clicking on a daily forecast card.



Animations: Smooth transitions and animations using Svelte's fade and fly effects for a better user experience.



Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices with a clean and modern UI.
